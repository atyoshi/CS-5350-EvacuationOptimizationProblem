START SIMULATION

Set time = 0
Count total people to evacuate
Make a copy of where everyone starts
Prepare a list for people "on the move"
Prepare a list to track how crowded each hallway/stair is

WHILE not everyone is evacuated AND there is enough time remaining:

    STEP 1: CHECK WHO JUST ARRIVED
       For every group currently moving:
           If their arrival time has come:
               - Take them off the "on the move" list
               - Free up space on the path they used
               - If they reached a SAFE ZONE:
                     Add them to "Evacuated" count
               - Otherwise:
                     Add them to the room they just entered

       If everyone is now safe - Done! All evacuees are safe!

    STEP 2: SEND PEOPLE OUT FROM ROOMS
       Did anyone move this round? - Not yet

       For each room in our top-down order:
           If there are people waiting in this room:
               - Use Dijkstra to find the fastest safe path out
               - Look at the first step: Room A -> Hallway B
               - Find how many people can fit at the moment
               - Send as many as possible (limited by space)

               If we send anyone:
                   - Mark that many as "on the move"
                   - Note when they’ll arrive
                   - Update: less people in room, more using the path
                   - Say: "X people leaving Room A -> going to B"

       If NO ONE moved AND no one is walking - Stop. No further movement possible.

    STEP 3: MOVE TIME FORWARD
       time = time + 1

END SIMULATION

RETURN:
   - Total people saved
   - Evacuation time
   - Remaining Evacuees
